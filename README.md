# Neural Style Transfer Notebook Setup and Usage

This notebook demonstrates Neural Style Transfer using PyTorch. Follow the steps below to set up and run the notebook.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- Pip (Python package installer) installed

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-style-transfer.git
    cd neural-style-transfer
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Notebook

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open the `neural_style_transfer.ipynb` notebook in your browser.

3. Run the notebook cells one by one.

4. Follow the instructions and adjust parameters as needed.

5. View the generated images and style transfer results.
